# Branch Naming Conventions 
When creating a new feature branch, it should be named semantically. 
Branch names should include the issue number that they relate to from Waffle. 

Example: "user-auth-2"

This means you're working on user authentication features, corresponding to issue #2 in Waffle. 

All branch names should be in kebab-case. Do not use capital letters or special characters in branch names.

Branch names should only contain lower case letters and numbers separated by `-`. 

# Creating a new issue 

If you find a bug or have a feature request, create an issue in Waffle (you can also do this through Github) and the issue will be dealt with and assigned accordingly. 

# Building for Production 

We use Docker to build for production. 

We're currently building off of the `kyma/docker-nginx` image. 

You can find documentation for this image at [here](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/docker-nginx)


```
# Build the app for production 
$ npm run build 

# Build a docker image
docker build -t hivemindapps/bandforge-vue-nginx:latest .

# Run the image to test and make sure everything works locally 
$ docker run -p 80:80 -d hivemindapps/bandforge-vue-nginx

# Point your browser to localhost and you should see the app pull up.
```
